Easily manage your projects - create ideation mind maps, Gantt charts, todo lists, and more!

## Ideation

Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.

Simply insert a Markdown `markmap` code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

A simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms
  - wowchemy-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms
  - wowchemy-plugins-reveal
```

## Diagrams

Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the `diagram` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.

An example **Gantt diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    gantt
    section Section
    Completed :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
    Active        :active,  des2, 2014-01-07, 3d
    Parallel 1   :         des3, after des1, 1d
    Parallel 2   :         des4, after des1, 1d
    Parallel 3   :         des5, after des3, 1d
    Parallel 4   :         des6, after des4, 1d
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
gantt
section Section
Completed :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
Active        :active,  des2, 2014-01-07, 3d
Parallel 1   :         des3, after des1, 1d
Parallel 2   :         des4, after des1, 1d
Parallel 3   :         des5, after des3, 1d
Parallel 4   :         des6, after des4, 1d
```

## Todo lists

You can even write your todo lists in Markdown too:

```markdown
- [x] Write math example
  - [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
```

renders as

- [x] Write math example
  - [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
